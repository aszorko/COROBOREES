# From real-time adaptation to social learning in robot ecosystems



## Unity executables (coming soon)

## Evaluation

The evaluation script `CPG/run_hebb.py` uses multiprocessing and is run from the command line in the virtual environment (e.g. via Slurm, see master branch for info). No arguments needed.


## Data

Data is contained in the `CPG/paper4_data/` directory.

`$python CPG/paper4_results1.py`
will run analyses on these data and produce Figures 2,3,4,5b and statistics.

`$python CPG/paper4_results2.py`
generates Figure 5a using the Unity interface. Must be run from command line in the virtual environment.
