# COROBOREES
***Collective robotics through real-time entrainment of evolved dynamical systems***

The master branch is updated continuously. Branches are made for reproduction of paper-specific data.

## Installing:
Clone the repository and create a Python virtual environment using CPG/requirements.txt.

## Paper1: Rapid rhythmic entrainment in bio-inspired central pattern generators

This is a Python-only implementation that evolves disembodied CPGs directly for flexible periods. Filters are evolved for period matching.

## Paper2: Central pattern generators evolved for real-time adaptation

This is a Python+Unity implementation. CPGs are evolved for stable backwards+forward+accelerating motion as control parameters are swept. Filters are evolved for period matching.
